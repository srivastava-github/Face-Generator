# Face Generation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic human faces. The model is trained on the high-quality Flickr-Faces-HQ (FFHQ) dataset.

## üåü Key Features

* **Realistic Face Generation**: The GAN learns to generate high-quality, 128x128 pixel images of human faces that are novel and not present in the original dataset.
* **Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) Architecture**: The core of the project is a DCGAN, which uses convolutional and transposed convolutional layers in the discriminator and generator, respectively.
* **Progressive Training Visualization**: The training process is monitored by saving and displaying generated images at regular intervals, showing the model's improvement over time.

## üöÄ How It Works

The project is based on the concept of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which consists of two neural networks competing against each other:

1.  **The Generator**: This network takes a random noise vector as input and attempts to generate a realistic image of a human face. It uses a series of transposed convolutional layers to upsample the noise into a 128x128 image.

2.  **The Discriminator**: This network is a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to distinguish between real images (from the FFHQ dataset) and fake images (generated by the Generator).

During training, the two networks are pitted against each other. The generator's goal is to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator's goal is to correctly identify the fake images. This adversarial process drives both networks to improve, resulting in a generator that can produce highly realistic faces.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.6+
* Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
* The required libraries, which can be installed via pip.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/face-generation-gan.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/face-generation-gan.git)
    cd face-generation-gan
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Download the dataset:** Download the [Flickr-Faces-HQ (FFHQ) dataset](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset) and place the images in the `data/` directory.

### Usage

1.  Open the `gan-flickerface-dataset.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
2.  Make sure the dataset path in the notebook is correctly set to your `data/` directory.
3.  Run the cells in the notebook to train the GAN. Generated images will be saved in the `generated_images/` directory.

## üìö Dataset

This project uses the **Flickr-Faces-HQ (FFHQ)** dataset, a high-quality image dataset of human faces. It consists of 70,000 PNG images at 1024x1024 resolution and contains considerable variation in age, ethnicity, and image background. For this project, the images are resized to 128x128.
